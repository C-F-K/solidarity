# Solidarity (or, Apples and Kittens)

An economic simulation game about the creation of value, adapted from *Bounty* (detailed [here](https://everything2.com/title/Six+Simulations))

## Setup and premise
Players organize into 4 groups representing economic organizations ("**orgs**"). These can consist of a single person or a "decision group". These are named North, South, East and West by default, but use whatever naming scheme makes sense. Each org starts with 2 **robots** which can perform **tasks**. The game is played over a series of rounds; each round consists of one **Strategy Board** turn (directing robot labor) and one **Citizens' Council** turn (deciding what to import/export from/to other orgs).

## Game flow
- Strategy board turn
    - Players write down their [**robot tasks**](#robot-tasks)
    - **Robot tasks** are revealed simultaneously and resolved (with help from referee if necessary)
- Citizens' council turn
    - Players trade to **resolve** **mandates** from last citizens' turn
        - if a player receives all the EcUs in a mandate, that mandate is **fulfilled**
        - a mandate is **resolved** whether it is fulfilled or not
    - Players write down what they want to trade for 
        - this list becomes a **mandate**, to be resolved next citizens' turn 
- End of round/next round

## Strategy Board turns 
The order in which you resolve your own robot tasks generally doesn't matter, unless it does. 
> E.g. you can invent a resource with one robot and start producing it with others in the same turn; you can anticipate that another org will produce a resource and order robots to attack a stockpile that didn't exist when you gave the order. 

However, robots aren't very sophisticated; if they can't follow an order, they do nothing. 
> So if the other player doesn't produce that resource, your attacking robots don't do anything that turn.

Also, a newly-built robot can't do anything until next turn. The referee can help when things get complicated.

## Citizens' Council turns
There are always things you can't get at home and have to import. During a citizens' turn, each org must create mandates worth an amount of EcU equal to half their largest stockpile.

Outstanding mandates are always resolved before new ones are created. As with robot tasks, order generally doesn't matter.
> E.g. if North wants to trade 3 apples to West for 2 kittens, but West needs to trade a gadget to South to get those kittens, then resolve West's mandate first. 

The only failed mandates are ones you can't fulfill at all on that turn. 
> So if nobody produced any kittens, North can't possibly fulfill that mandate. 

Deciding *who* you want to trade with is ultimately just a statement of intent. 
> If North ends up getting the kittens from South instead, the mandate is still fulfilled.

You can trade nothing for something, if you can get the other player to agree. (You can threaten to attack their resources if they don't, and of course you're also free to keep or break that promise.) 

## Robot tasks

### **Invent**
Invent a new resource. This can be anything the players can think of. Examples: "apples", "kittens", "gadgets", "widgets"

Take a post-it note (or similar), write the resource name on it, and place it in front of the player. This represents control of that resource; a player who controls a resource can direct their robots to produce it.

### **Produce**
Produce a resource you control.

Take a counter (coins, matches, etc.) and place it on the appropriate post-it note to represent your stockpile of that resource. Each one is a single economic unit (**EcU**); you can give these a name when you invent the resource (eg. bushels of apples, litters of kittens), but for practical purposes it takes a robot 1 turn to produce 1 EcU of anything. These will be scored at the end of the game.

Alternatively, robots can build more robots. 1 robot can build another robot in 1 turn, just like producing an EcU, but robots don't count for endgame scores.

### **Attack**
Attack a resource controlled by another org, or a stockpile of that resource.

Because robot tasks resolve at the same time, a resource is defended by the robots currently producing it. Attacking and defending robots destroy each other, 1:1. Alternatively, each robot can destroy a single EcU in a stockpile. Robots attacking stockpiles are not destroyed.

If there are any attacking robots left after the defenders are destroyed, the attacker takes control of the resource. Move the post-it (or cross out the name and give the attacker a new post-it). The defender keeps their stockpile, unless the attacker also ordered robots to attack that. A single robot can't attack both a resource and its stockpile.

Robots aren't a resource and can't be seized or attacked directly: players can always build more robots. If a player loses their last robot in an attack, a single new robot is airdropped to them at the end of the turn.

## Endgame and scoring
The game may be played over a fixed number of rounds, or you can decide to end the game after a random number of rounds: set a minimum length, and roll some dice after the end of each round beyond that. If you roll equal to or below the current round number, the game ends.

Players score points in one of two ways, through **Greed** or through **Solidarity**; when running multiple games at the same time, each group of 4 orgs should receive its objectives secretly (referees can help with this).

### **Greed**
Greed scoring takes place at the end of the game.

Orgs score 1 point for each EcU in their stockpiles that they did not originally invent.
Orgs score 3 points for each stockpile they own which is the largest of its kind.

This means that under Greed rules, the most reliable ways to score are by attacking other orgs' stockpiles and seizing their resources.
> E.g. if West invents kittens, and North seizes control of them, North will score for each kitten they produce; the only way West can score for kittens is by having the most of them, and that can only give West a maximum of 3 points.

### **Solidarity**
Solidarity scoring takes place round-by-round.

Orgs score 1 point for every 3 EcU in a fulfilled mandate, or 3 points per mandate fulfilled, whichever is more.

If, at the end of the game, one player has more points than any other two combined, everyone loses. Otherwise, everyone wins. **Referees don't reveal this until the game is over.** This means that the most reliable way to score is to act with solidarity, both with your own org's citizens and with other orgs. Trying to game the system to win is really just playing under Greed rules with a twist.
